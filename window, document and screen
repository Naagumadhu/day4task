JavaScript: window, document and screen:
      In JavaScript, window, document, and screen are distinct objects that represent different aspects of a web browser and its environment.

Window Object:
      The window object represents a browser window and acts as a global object in client-side JavaScript. It encapsulates the entire browser window, including tabs, frames, and iframes. The 
Window object provides access to various properties and methods associated with the browser environment, such as opening new windows, resizing, scrolling, and interacting with the browser's 
history.

Document Object:
      The document object represents the current web page displayed in the browser window. It provides access to the HTML content of the page and allows you to manipulate structure, content,
and styling using the Document Object Model (DOM). With the document object, you can access elements, change their attributes and content, and respond to user interactions.

Screen Object:
      The screen object refers to the user's screen dimensions and display properties. It provides information such as width, height, color depth and pixel density of the user's screen. 
Screen Material is useful for creating responsive designs and adapting content to different screen sizes.
